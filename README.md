Project Idea
Our project is a web application that allows users to buy and sell clothing items. Users can create accounts and upload their own items for sale such as shoes, shirts, and pants. Users can also purchase items that other people are selling using our checkout process. All users can view a profile page where they can see what’s currently in their cart, items that they currently have for sale, and basic user information such as their username and email. Finally, users can setup alerts to notify them when certain items are in stock or when certain items reach a specific price.

The project was motivated because current online reselling platforms have very narrow windows of time where certain products are in stock or are on sale, and it’s difficult for users to act on these opportunities because there’s no easy way to know when the products they want are being sold at the price they want. Our app solves this problem by allowing users to set up the alert system mentioned above.


Implementation
We plan on using HTML, JavaScript, React and Node JS tentatively. For now, we plan on using MongoDB and Node for the backend, and React for the frontend.


Features
When users would like to sell clothing items on our website, they will input details about the item and images of it; this data will be stored in our back-end. The images and descriptions will be dynamically displayed to the user whenever new items are added. Our website also allows users to filter clothing items by category (shoes, shirts, pants, etc.), meaning our app will have to search through server-side data.



These are the major features of our application:

Users can create accounts and sign in
Users can see a profile page which shows their cart and items that they’ve posted for sale
Users can upload their own items for sale
Store page will show all products, and will allow users to filter by category or search for specific items
Users can checkout
Checkout will not use real payments
Users can set up alerts to get notified when a certain product is on sale or when a certain product reaches a certain price
