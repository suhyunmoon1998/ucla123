## Project Description
Our project is a web application that allows users to buy and sell clothing items. Users can create accounts and upload their own items for sale such as shoes, shirts, and pants. Users can also purchase items that other people are selling using our checkout process. All users can view a profile page where they can see whatâ€™s currently in their cart, items that they currently have for sale, and basic user information such as their username and email. Users can also like items and filter through items to make the shopping experinece easier and faster.
